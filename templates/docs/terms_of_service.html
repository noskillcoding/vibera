<p>Welcome to vibera, a platform for developers to showcase their projects. In using our services, you are agreeing to the following Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please take a moment to read them thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="acceptance-of-terms">Acceptance of Terms</h3>
<p>By accessing and using vibera, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use our services.</p>

<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
<p>While regular readers do not have any cookies set, once an account is created there will be 2 cookies set in the user's browser to ensure they remain logged in and operate in their local timezone instead of the server timezone.</p>

<h3 id="subdomain-usage">Subdomain Usage</h3>
<p>Vibera promotes fair use of subdomain names and strictly prohibits domain squatting or the claiming of an unreasonable number of subdomains. This is to ensure all users have equal opportunity to claim a desired subdomain.</p>

<h3 id="space-usage">Space Usage</h3>
<p>Subdomains that remain empty and unused for a prolonged period of time are subject to removal. This is to maintain the active and vibrant community and prevent subdomain squatting.</p>

<h3 id="anti-spam-and-blocking">Anti-Spam and Blocking</h3>
<p>Vibera has a zero-tolerance policy for spam. We have in place strict anti-spam measures and reserve the right to block any user found to be engaged in spamming or related activities. This includes but is not limited to mass-posting, chain-posting, and uninvited promotional activities.</p>

<h3 id="user-content">User Content</h3>
<p>While users of vibera maintain ownership of their content, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse to host any content. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, a violation of these Terms, or any applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<h3 id="modifications-to-terms">Modifications to Terms</h3>
<p>Vibera may, from time to time, revise these Terms. Your continued use of the service after changes have been made signifies your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
