<p>Vibera has built-in comments on all drops. Comments are enabled by default and let people give feedback on your projects.</p>

<h2 id="how-comments-work">How comments work</h2>
<p>Comments appear on drops (but not pages). Users must log in to vibera to comment.</p>

<p>When commenting, users can show their name as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nickname</strong> - If set in account settings</li>
<li><strong>Email address</strong> - Their vibera email</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous</strong> - No name shown</li>
</ul>

<p>Users can delete their own comments anytime.</p>

<h2 id="turning-comments-off">Turning comments off</h2>
<p>Use the checkbox when editing a drop, or add this to your drop content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>title: My Project
comments_enabled: false
___
Your drop content here...
</pre></div>

<h2 id="reports">Reports</h2>
<p>Users can report drops that contain dangerous or inappropriate content. Reports help keep the platform safe.</p>

<p>To report a drop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users must be logged in</li>
<li>Write a brief explanation (5-100 characters)</li>
<li>Choose to show your nickname or email as reporter</li>
<li>Each user can only have one active report per drop</li>
</ul>

<p>Reports appear at the bottom of drops in a collapsible section. Users can delete their own reports.</p>

<h2 id="other-features">Other features</h2>
<p>Vibera also has upvoting and a discovery feed for popular drops.</p>
